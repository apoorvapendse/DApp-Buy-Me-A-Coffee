**Features:**

- **Simple Payment Process**: Users can make payments for virtual coffees by sending Ether to the contract.
- **Prevent Duplicate Payments**: The contract ensures that each user can make only one payment, preventing duplication.
- **Transparent Records**: All payment details, including the buyer's email, address, and payment amount, are stored in the contract.
- **Withdrawal Mechanism**: The contract owner can securely withdraw accumulated funds from the contract balance.
- **User-Friendly Interaction**: Functions allow users to view their payment history and retrieve individual payment details.

**Frontend:**

The frontend for this smart contract is built using React and makes use of the Web3.js library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides an intuitive user interface for contributors to make payments and for creators to withdraw their received funds.

**Network Compatibility:**

Currently, the project is set up to accept Goerli testnet Ether. Please ensure that you are connected to the Goerli network when interacting with the DApp.
